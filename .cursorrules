# Import Paths Rules

- Always use import paths like "@/MY_PATH_HERE..."

# Modular Structure Rules

- Always use a modular folder structure when working with multiple related files. Group related files into dedicated folders whenever it makes sense, to keep the project organized and maintainable.

# Code Language Rule

- All code-related elements must be written in English, including variable names, function names, class names, comments, and documentation within the code. This rule applies even if the application's interface or the conversation is in another language.

# Language Consistency Rule

- Always follow these rules regardless of the language used during the chat or request. The instructions apply consistently whether the conversation is in English, Portuguese, or any other language.
